Out of my personal interest I designed a weather station, that displays the weather of two cities on an E-paper display and updates every 10 minutes.

* Designed and wrote the code in python for a weather station which takes the weather data through openweathermap api and displays the weather of two cities on a 7.8‚Äù epaper display attached to a raspberry pi.

* Designed and 3-D printed a case for the whole system to put it in one place. Please check the project repositiory link below to check the final product.
