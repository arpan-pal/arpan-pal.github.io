While participating at Math to Industry bootcamp, hosted by Institute for Mathematics and its Applications, University of Minnesota, during Summer 2022 we worked on a U.S. Bank sponsored project on predicting prepayments in Mortgage Backed Securities (MBS).

* Investigated and created an 87% accurate linear regression model of various macroeconomic factors such as,
Home Price Appreciation (HPA), Housing Credit Availability Index (HCAI), Geographic Mobility, on the rate
of mortgage prepayments (CPR) in a top-down approach.

* As a bottom-up approach assessed and modeled effect of current interest rate on prepayment rate among bor-
rowers from 3 different cohorts of credit-score.
