While participating at the Erdős Institute bootcamp during Summer 2022 we worked on a project for predicting the cuisine of a recipe from the list of its ingredients.

* Analyzed the text data of ingredients for recipes from 20 different cuisines.

* Cleaned the data and trained multiple different classification algorithms using Word2Vec, Neural Network, XGBoost, Random Forest, and came up with an 80% accurate classification model for predicting cuisines from ingredients
