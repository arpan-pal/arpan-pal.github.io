I am a final year PhD student in Math at Texas A&M University. My primary research interest lies in Geometric Complexity Theory and I am working under the supervision of [Prof Joseph M Landsberg](https://math.tamu.edu/~jml).



As a PhD in Mathematics with a focus in Theoretical Computer Science and Complexity Theory, I have worked on the
problems surrounding the exponent of matrix multiplication. My research explores the area of minimal border rank
tensors, which play a crucial role in achieving the state-of-the-art bound for the exponent of matrix multiplication
using Coppersmith-Winograd tensor. My research focuses on studying the geometric properties of these tensors and
their applications in fields such as Phylogenetics and Algebraic Statistics. I have also worked on problems related
to Algebraic Statistics and Convolution Neural Networks, and have a deep understanding of Algebraic Geometry,
Representation Theory, Lie Algebras, Deep Learning, and Statistics.
