I am currently working as Research Impacts Data Analyst at [Institute for Interdisciplinary Data Sciences](https://www.iids.uidaho.edu/people.php), [University of Idaho](https://www.uidaho.edu/). 
In this role, my primary objective is to empower the university administration to make well-informed decisions by effectively analyzing and leveraging diverse research data generated across the institution. 
Key responsibilities encompass developing robust systems and tools to manage and analyze research-related information, including grants, awards, and publications. 
I actively collaborate with various departments to enhance their data quality and improve data interoperability, ensuring the availability of comprehensive and up-to-date research insights. 
Utilizing my expertise in data analytics, I create visually appealing and intuitive data visualization dashboards that provide actionable insights for university stakeholders. 
I develop AI and large language model(LLM) powered tools to streamline workflow of different processes across the university.

Before joining my current job at the University of Idaho I completed my PhD in Mathematics at Texas A&M University with my primary research area lying in Geometric Complexity Theory, under the supervision of [Prof Joseph M Landsberg](https://math.tamu.edu/~jml).

As a PhD in Mathematics with a focus in Theoretical Computer Science and Complexity Theory, I have worked on the
problems surrounding the exponent of matrix multiplication. My research explores the area of minimal border rank
tensors, which play a crucial role in achieving the state-of-the-art bound for the exponent of matrix multiplication
using Coppersmith-Winograd tensor. My research focuses on studying the geometric properties of these tensors and
their applications in fields such as Phylogenetics and Algebraic Statistics. I have also worked on problems related
to Algebraic Statistics and Convolution Neural Networks, and have a deep understanding of Algebraic Geometry,
Representation Theory, Lie Algebras, Deep Learning, and Statistics.
