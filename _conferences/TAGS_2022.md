Attended an intense six-week long bootcamp designed to provide graduate students with training and experience that is valuable for employment outside of academia. The program is targeted at Ph.D. students in pure and applied mathematics. The boot camp consists of courses in the basics of programming, data analysis, and mathematical modeling. Students work in teams on projects and are provided with training in resume and interview preparation as well as teamwork. 

Towards the end completed a U.S. Bank sponsored project on predicting prepayments in Mortgage Backed Securities (MSB). Please check the [_bootcamp webpage_][def] for more information.
