A staged tree model is a discrete statistical model encoding relationships between events. These models are realised by directed trees with colored vertices. In algebraic geometry language these models are also described by certain varieties and it is often beneficial to see if the variety has toric structure. In 2021 Görgen, Maraj, and Nicklasson [[1]](#GMN21) showed that all staged tree models with depth at most 3 and having only one color are inherently described by a toric variety, and conjectured that same continues to be the case for trees with any depth. We show that it is no longer the case for staged tree models with depth 4 and disprove their conjecture. This is a joint work with [Aida Maraj](https://sites.google.com/view/aidamaraj/home).
