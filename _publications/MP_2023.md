The motivation for this paper is to detect when an irreducible projective variety $V$ is not toric. We do this by analyzing a Lie group and a Lie algebra associated to $V$. If the dimension of $V$ is strictly less than the dimension of the above mentioned objects, then $V$ is not a toric variety. We provide an algorithm to compute the Lie algebra of an irreducible variety and use it to provide examples of non-toric statistical models in algebraic statistics.

Staged tree models are discrete statistical models, generalizing Bayesian networks, and are described by algebraic varieties. A particularly nice class of varieties for computational purposes are the _toric_ varieties. If the staged tree mdel's variety is toric, it offers a Markov basis, helpful for hypothesis testing, and fecilitates the study of maximum likelihood estimates. In 2021 Görgen, Maraj, and Nicklasson [[1]](#GMN21) showed that the variety for staged tree models with one color having at most 3 children at each vertex, and depth at most 3, are toric, and conjectured that same continues to be the case for trees with any depth with one color. We showed that their conjecture fails in depth 4, using methods form geometry and representation theory. This is a joint work with [Aida Maraj](https://sites.google.com/view/aidamaraj/home). -->
